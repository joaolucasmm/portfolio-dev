                    I have been studying physics engineering since 2017 at UFRGS. I started working with development when I took a technical course in mechatronics in 2014. In 2022, I switched to front end development and became a React developer. In 2023, I started an internship in the Rotation program at SAP where I worked as Technical Support, Quality Assurance Engineer, and currently I am a Software Engineer Intern.
