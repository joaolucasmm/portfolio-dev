                    <p className='banner__bio'>I have been studying physics engineering since 2017 at UFRGS.
                    I started working with development when I took a technical course in mechatronics in 2014.
                    In 2022, I switched to front end development and became a React developer.
                    In 2023, I started an internship in the Rotation program at SAP where I worked as Technical Support,
                    Quality Assurance Engineer, and currently I am a Software Engineer Intern.</p>
